# Problem 2 - Permutation, Drop and Matching
Assume one input symbol A : 3 . The output be as follows: for each input row a1, a2, a3 of A the output should contain a row a3,a1 but only if a1 and a2 are equal. The output arity is two.

Notice that the output is sorted lexicographically: for this reason the row starting with “Carter” comes before the row starting with “Timms” in the expected output of Example 1. Example 3 shows that the empty string is lexicographically less than non-empty strings and that empty string is a value that is equal to the empty string when matching.
