# Problem 1 - Conjunction
Assume two input symbols A : 2 and B : 2 both of arity two. Output a conjunction of the two files so that each output row is selected from each pairing of a row in A and a row in B with entries output in the following order: for each row a1, a2 in A and each row b1, b2 in B, output a row a1, a2, b1, b2. The output arity is therefore four.

In Example 3, the input file A is empty, so there are no possible input rows a1, a2: for this reason, the overall output is empty. The order of the output should be sorted lexicographically
